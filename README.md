## Trace-Crawler  based on StormCrawler see https://github.com/DigitalPebble/storm-crawler/wiki. 
Produces WARC files to be stored in ./warcs/warcstore directory.
The plugin to execute the trace  is done thru navigation filter of StormCrawler.
The trace is a json file where web page navigation steps are recorded in tree-like data structure.
The navigation filter interprets the json data structure and issues selenium api calls to the selenium hub. Hub is the central point in the Selenium Grid that routes the JSON  commands to the individual browsers-nodes. The Remote Web Driver is configured with proxy, so the http api calls are done with  proxy service, warcprox, to record all traffic to warc files. 
For each url seed the crawler starts and stops personal proxy when it finishes to make sure that all navigation steps of particular trace and corresponding embedded resources are well separated into a single warc file. Thus this is selective crawling where we want to archive web resource with well defined boundaries.
The software to create the trace  can be found at https://github.com/mementoweb/tracer-extension

## Build the Project:
* if you do not want to use docker go to the portals-crawler directory and follow instructions 
* or see docker instructions below
 
## Compile the trace-crawler

 you must first generate an uberjar:

``` sh
cd ./portals-crawler
$ mvn clean package
```   



## Run trace-crawler Topology on Docker
A configuration to run the topologies via docker-compose is provided. 
The file ./docker-compose.yaml puts every component (Mysql, Apache storm, Warcproxy, Chrome Selenium hub) into  containers.
First we launch all components:



``` sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up --build  --remove-orphans
docker-compose run

```
Now we can launch the container tracer-archiver
``` sh
docker-compose run --rm tracer-archiver
```
and in the running container first  topology to load seeds to mysql:
``` sh
tracer-crawler> storm jar tracer-crawler.jar   gov.lanl.crawler.SeedInjector /seeds seedswithtraces.txt   -conf crawler-conf-docker.yaml
```
and in the running container second  topology to run crawler:
``` sh
tracer-crawler> storm jar tracer-crawler.jar  gov.lanl.crawler.CrawlTopology -conf crawler-conf-docker.yaml
```

Let's check whether topology is running:
``` sh
tracer-crawler> storm list
```
To kill the topology
``` sh
tracer-crawler> storm kill SeedInjector -w 10
```
Let's check logs - logs are mapped to host machine at /data
``` sh
ls -la data/supervisor/logs/workers-artifacts/*/*/worker.log
more data/supervisor/logs/workers-artifacts/CrawlTopology-1-1644877391/6700/worker.log
```
to leave the container (exit) and shut down all running containers:
``` sh
docker-compose down
```

to look at the mysql db
``` sh
docker exec -it tracer-db /bin/bash
```
in the contaner
``` sh
mysql -u cache -p 
```
at  the mysql prompt:
``` sh
use portals;
show tables;
select * from urls;
if you want to clean the db:  delete from urls;
```
if you want to bring back url to crawl again  for testing 
``` sh
update urls set status='DISCOVERED',nextfetchdate='2018-01-21 15:41:22' where url='https://wormbase.org/species/c_elegans/gene/WBGene00006604#0-9g-3';
```
Also the Storm UI on localhost is available and will provide metrics about the running topology.
## Configuration trace-crawler
the  configuration file at  the file ./storm-docker-conf/crawler-conf-docker.yaml 
* default points out to traces config file
``` 
navigationfilters.config.file: "boundary-filters3.json"
  
```
The ./seeds , ./traces, ./warcs, ./data, ./certs directories are shared between docker container and host machine.
